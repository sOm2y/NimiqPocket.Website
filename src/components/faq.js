  Nimiqpocket pool is running PPLNS. PPLNS stands for Pay Per Last (luck) N Shares. 
  This method calculates your payments based on the number of shares you submitted during a shift. 
  It includes shift system which is time based or by number of shares submitted by the miners on the pool. 
  Your pool may find blocks consistently or in overtime it may have huge variations in winning a block and that ultimately affects your payments. 
  PPLNS greatly involves luck factor and youâ€™ll notice huge fluctuations in your 24 hour payout. 
  If you maintain your mining on a single pool then your payouts will remain consistent and it only differs when new miners join or leave the pool.
